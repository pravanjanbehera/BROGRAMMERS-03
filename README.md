# ♻️ EcoVision: AI-Powered Circular Waste Intelligence
**"Transforming waste into value through Computer Vision and Predictive Analytics."**

EcoVision is a smart end-to-end solution designed to automate waste identification, predict generation trends, and provide actionable recommendations for a circular economy. By digitizing waste management, we reduce landfill pollution and maximize recycling efficiency.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Improper waste segregation, delayed collection, and lack of data-driven monitoring lead to overflowing bins and increased landfill pollution. Manual tracking is slow and inaccurate. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically analyze waste using images, predict generation hotspots, and recommend smart reuse/recycling actions to support a circular economy.

## 🧩 Project Modules

### 1️⃣ Image-Based Waste Detection
* **Function:** User uploads or clicks a waste image.
* **ML Logic:** CNN model detects waste category (Plastic, Metal, Organic, Glass, Paper) and estimates bin fullness levels.

### 2️⃣ Automatic Data Generation & Storage
* **Function:** Converts image classification outputs into structured data.
* **Storage:** Logs Date, Time, Waste Type, and Fill Level automatically for administrative tracking.

### 3️⃣ Waste Analytics Dashboard
* **Visuals:** Real-time charts showing waste trends and area-wise generation.
* **Impact:** Provides recycling statistics and landfill diversion metrics at a glance.

### 4️⃣ ML-Based Hotspot Prediction
* **Intelligence:** Uses historical logs to predict future waste quantity.
* **Action:** Identifies high-risk areas before overflow happens, allowing for optimized collection routes.

### 5️⃣ Smart Recommendations & Circular Economy
* **Innovation:** Suggests the best "Value-Added" action for detected waste.
* **Suggestions:** DIY reuse projects for non-biodegradables and composting guides for organic waste.

### 6️⃣ Environmental Impact Awareness
* **Goal:** Calculates and displays the reduction in carbon footprint and landfill usage to encourage responsible habits.
